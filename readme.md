# 'is_this_loss' 
###  A nostalgic mutation of intellivisions SNAFU.
  
  A multiplayer snake game.  I have never made a non-local multiplayer game before.
  This project is for me to understand the best patterns related to online multiplayer backends.
  
  The scoring is determined by who survived the longest.
  
  The rules of each match are unknown, taken from a set of mutatable rules.
  Sometimes the outter wall is not the limit, but how big is the hidden limit?
  Sometimes the length slowly increases over time, other times it increases with each step.
  
  The goal is to make it functional, then make it ellegant.  The goal is also to avoid module use.
  
  Currently I am using only socket.io 
  
  security is not an focus in the least.  
  
  Perhaps if someone understands the nuts and bolts to a self-styled socket.io or session permanence pattern you could do me a solid and clue me in.
